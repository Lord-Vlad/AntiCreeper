# AntiCreeper

This datapack prevents creepers from destroying your world by changing the explosion radius to 0.
Unfortunately, this also means that creepers no longer deal damage to players.
As a replacement creepers spawn fireworks regularly and cause some damage.
If you want to disable this go to *'**data/ac/functions/config.mcfunction**'* and change *'**1**'* to *'**0**'*.
